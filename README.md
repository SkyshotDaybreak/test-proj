# Godot Test Project

Started 10/27/23
 
First Godot project, basically just a sketchbook project to learn the software.

File organization, code, and addon dependancies are very scuffed. On the .NET Godot version for Qodot/Trenchbroom workflow. This ended up being an issue for Compatability rendering and exporting for web (Godot 4 using C#/.NET doesn't currently support web exporting).
